# Advent of Code 2020

Here are my advent of code solutions for 2020. I did them in TypeScript. Run
`ts-node day01/main.ts` to run that the program of day 1. The `rem` folders
are slightly changed up versions of that same day. I did this for some days
where I wanted to make things clearer or smaller.
